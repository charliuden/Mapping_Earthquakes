# Mapping Earthquakes

This repository contains scripts to display maps of earthquake occurrences and tectonic plate boundaries on an html page. 

## Data Sources

Earthquake data comes from USGS in point geoJSON format: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson. The dataset contains earthquakes that have happened over the past 7 days across the globe. 

Tectonic plate boundaries come from this GitHub repository: https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates. The data is in line-string geoJSON format. For more information on the dataset, see the repository's readme. 


Below is a screen shot of the plate boundaries and earthquake occurrences displayed on an html page:
